\section{Which files contain what}

You will most often only have to change \texttt{main.tex}, which contains
title, author etc.; and \texttt{contents.tex}, which contains the main content;
and sometimes \texttt{defs.tex}, which contains packages and corresponding
options, and headers. You will only have to compile using the following
commands (alternately via \texttt{arara}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{pdflatex main}
	\item \texttt{bibtex main}
	\item \texttt{pdflatex main}
	\item \texttt{pdflatex main}
\end{itemize}

During preparation if you only run \texttt{pdflatex main}, this would be
faster, the only problem would be that references and citations would not be
proper.

\textbf{Save the final pdf document such that it contains the report number
(see top right of the page)}

\section{Tables}

Use \texttt{booktabs} package. An example is Tab.~\ref{tb:sample}

\begin{table}
\caption{The example table from \texttt{booktabs} package.}
	\label{tb:sample}
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}}
\toprule
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} \\
\cmidrule(r){1-2}Animal & Description & Price (\$)\\
\midrule
Gnat  & per gram  & 13.65 \\
& each      & 0.01 \\
Gnu   & stuffed   & 92.50 \\
Emu   & stuffed   & 33.33 \\
Armadillo & frozen & 8.99 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Figures}

Your sources figures should be either \texttt{.pdf} or \texttt{.eps} vector
graphics (not converting \texttt{png, jpg} etc. to pdf/eps but true vector
graphics!) unless impossible.

Use \texttt{subfig} package to include multiple figures with the same caption.

\section{References, citations}

You should have a \texttt{.bib} file (\texttt{bib.bib} in this template folder)
containing bibtex entries.

Use bibtex (the compilation order would be pdflatex - bibtex - pdflatex -
pdflatex for the final compilation because it takes to pdflatex commands to
properly include references).

See \texttt{http://merkel.texture.rocks/Latex/natbib.php} for details and
options for citation using \texttt{natbib} (included in the template; in
\texttt{defs.tex})

Most importantly theres two main ways for referencing: \texttt{citet} and
\texttt{citep}.

\texttt{citep} is the same as \texttt{cite} and the refernces is as:
\citep{Karamcheti1956}. \texttt{citet} is text citation and is as:
\citet{Karamcheti1956}.

You can refer your own previous reports by following the \texttt{techreport}
bibtex style:

\begin{verbatim}
@techreport{Who2019-07,
author = {D. Who},
title = {Internal report format},
institution = {abs Lab, Institute of LT},
number = {2019(07)21},
year = 2019
}
\end{verbatim}
